        A film clip archive on tobacco, alcohol, drugs and gambling was
assembled, consisting of 140 scenes from 47 Finnish and international films. A
typology of representations of addiction is developed on the basis of the semiotic theory
of modalities. It centres around four modal groups: willing, competence, ability and
obligation. The classical image of modern addiction is lack of will or loss of control.
This is represented in alcoholism films with strong AA-influence. Competence is often
involved in drug scenes showing people enjoying their individualistic freedom and skill
in building authentic identities. Ability is a core theme in gambling movies but
sometimes it plays a role in alcoholism scenes too. Obligation, or necessity, plays a role
in especially drug scenes where the subject struggles with a pressing desire or need.
